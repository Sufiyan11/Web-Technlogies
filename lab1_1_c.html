<font size="15"><b>Deforestation</b></font><br>
<font size="5">Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and <br>into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and<br> animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction.</font>
<font size="11"><b><br>Slash-and-burn agriculture</b></font><br>
<font size="5">Slash-and-burn agriculture is a big contributor to deforestation in the tropics.<br> With this agricultural method, farmers burn large swaths of forest, allowing<br>the ash to fertilize the land for crops.</font>
<font size="8"><b><br>Cause</b></font><br>
<font size="5">Direct causes of deforestation are agricultural expansion, wood extraction<br>(e.g., logging or wood harvest for domestic fuel or charcoal), and infrastructure<br>expansion such as road building and urbanization</font>
